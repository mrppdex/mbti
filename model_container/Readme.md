## Create Model Container

Once you create files using scripts from the `create_files` directory, you can build and push a corresponding docker container to your docker hub repository. 

NOTE:

`make.sh` script should work, but is not tested, because I was using Windows PowerShell instead due to lack of disk space on my Mac.
